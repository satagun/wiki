</h1>
<p>
    In this literature review, we present literature related to our Project
    Management System project. We will first introduce Project Management
    Systems (PMS). Secondly, we explain why the project management system
    should be used, its logic, properties, types and advantages. Due to PMS,
    even those who do not have high-level computer usage information without
    code knowledge can take tasks in important projects, undertake project
    follow-up and report projects. In addition, the system is based on web
    technologies, that for reason we can easily access the system anywhere in
    the world. In this literature, we will explain similar systems and what is
    used differently than these systems.
</p>

<h1>
    <a name="_Toc482178660">1. What is a Project Management System?</a>
</h1>
<p>
    The project management system is used to manage the project. Project
    management system is the planning, reporting and control of project
    activities to reach the project objectives. When these activities are
    carried out, it is necessary to stay within performance, cost, time limits
    and to keep project size within acceptable limits. Project management
    provides us installation, using, management and simple features make simple
    use without technical knowledge. [4]
</p>
<p>
    The project management system we will do provide both of a single user and
    common users that collaborative system. A single user system is programmed
    with the assumption that one person will make changes at the same time in
    the project plan. Also common users can programmed project at the same
    time.

<h3>
    <a name="_Toc482178662">1.1.1 Project Start</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The starting part of the project is very important because if this step
    does not start correctly, the other steps will also be adversely affected.
    The PMA guides the user in the right way for the correct steps to be taken
    when starting the project and for the planning phase.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Toc482178663">1.1.2 Planning of the project</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Errors in the planning phase will cause major obstacles to the success of
    the project, such as the start-up phase. For this reason, the PMA provides
    that important phase is done correctly by choosing who should be involved
    in the project, the role choices of the people involved in the project, and
    topics.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Toc482178664">1.1.3 Project follow-up and control</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The control and observation phase consists of timely recognition of
    problems in the implementation of the project and timely corrective actions
    and procedures to control implementation. An important benefit of this
    phase is the difference in implementation from the project management plan
    through the monitoring and measurement of project performance.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Toc482178665">1.1.4 Completion of the project</a>
</h3>
<p>
    It includes formal completion of the project. Administrative activities
    include archiving the files and documenting the lessons learned.

    <a name="_Toc482178666">1.2 PMA Benefits</a>
</h2>
<p>
    · Easy reach to personal &amp;projects information
</p>
<p>
    · It offers objective tracking.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reducing paperwork
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · It makes anyone a quick study.
</p>
<p>
    · Easy communication between team members.
</p>
<p>
    Besides these, there are many advantages of PMA web-based. These;
</p>
<p>
    · Access to any type of computer without the need to install software on
    the user's computer
</p>
<p>
    · Convenience in access control
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Single and multi-user
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · One version and software to be maintained
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Central data warehouse
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Project information cannot be accessed when the user (or server) is

    Redmine [1], Redmine is a web-based project management and bug tracking
    system software that is widely used all over the world. First released in
    2006, Redmine is a free software that is an important part of the
    development infrastructure of tens of thousands of progenies in different
    sectors, especially computer software projects.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most important features that distinguish Redmine from similar
    vehicles is that it offers extensive privatization possibilities. With
    Redmine, you can define and customize project-specific areas that have
    important functions in project management such as business records,
    business processes, user roles, wikis, and discussion areas

    SebaPLUS [2] refers to Semantic e-Business applications, which enable you
    to manage all your activities that are important for carrying out your
    business through a single web-based system. You can use your company's
    internal activities and outgoing relationships in a single system Is the
    whole of the applications that enable you to make the institutional
    organization by allowing you to reach out to the executive from the one
    place where you want to report about your company.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the two similar programs we have compared above, there is a
    rewarding and punishment system in the project that we want to do. The aim
    of the systems is to directly contribute to the motivation and productivity
    of the operating personnel, to increase the satisfaction of the business so
    this system can be considered as an incentive program and a positive force
    for employees. For these reasons, the rewarding and punishment system that
    we use in our project makes a very important difference. Accordingly,
    project users who complete the project on the specified deadline and meet
    the requirements will be rewarded with premium or extra vacation. This
    prize varies according to the importance of the project. At the same time,
    there is a penalty for the project that does not finish on the specified
    date or is completed without meeting the requirements. This penalty will be
    given by the administrator. The penalized person will not be able to take
    part in subsequent projects or the roles on other projects will be limited.

</h1>
<p>
    During this research, we learned a lot about the Project management
    assistant Systems. We tried to answer a lot of questions about what this
    system is, what it does, what are the benefits, what your web development
    technology and features are, and what applications are related to them. By
    the general structure of the system, we tried to give information about
    project and project cycle management concepts and phases, the phases of
    project development and planning within the scope of logical framework
    approach, and how to evaluate the project proposals using criteria.
    Finally, we tried to explain the basic concepts used in project management
    together.
